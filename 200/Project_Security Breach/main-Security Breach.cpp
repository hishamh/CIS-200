  Program 4 warehouse thief

 **************************Software description (PDF):*****************************
 There is a shipment of exotic gems, gold, and movie snacks in a warehouse
    where you are helping your  best in stealing good of boxes whiteout out alerting
    the security cameras. The shipment is stored in large cubical crates, all of which
    have identical dimensions. These crates are stacked in neat piles, forming a
    three-dimensional grid. The security system takes pictures of the piles once
    every hour using three cameras: a front camera, a side camera, and a top camera.
    The front camera shows the height of the tallest pile in each column, the side
    camera shows the height of the tallest pile in each row, and the top camera
    shows whether or not each pile is empty.

 If the security system detects a change in any of these images, it sounds an alarm.
     Once Butch is inside, he will determine the heights of the piles and send them
     to you. Butch wants to steal as many crates as possible. Since he canâ€™t
     disable the security system, he plans to fool it by arranging the remaining
     crates into piles so that the next set of camera images are the same.
     In the above example, it is possible to steal nine crates. The post-heist
     figure shows that the cameras will detect an identical configuration.

 **********************************Program rules********************************
 1)	Rows and number can be between 1 to 100 for each row and column
 2)	Each of the following r lines contains c integers, indicating the heights (in crates) of the piles in the corresponding row
 3)	All heights for the row is between 0 and 109
