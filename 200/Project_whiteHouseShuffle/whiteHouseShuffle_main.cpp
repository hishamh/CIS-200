 White House Shue:
    This program sumlaite the process of Presidential campaigns where a President can hire staff to help him get elected.
    Moreover, each staff can hire people to work for them. For example if YOU hire A,B,C to work for you; 'A' can hire D,E
    to work for him. Also The President can fire people who work for him, For example President TR can Fire A,B,C. And 'A'
    Fire D,E

 ______________________________________________Rules of Firing staff(from PDF)____________________________________________

 If the victim (the person who gets red) had no subordinates, then he or she will simply be dropped from the white
 house's hierarchy. If the victim had any subordinates, then his or her highest-ranking (by seniority) direct subordinate
 will be promoted to ll the resulting vacancy.The promoted person will also inherit the victim's seniority. Now,
 if the promoted person also had some subordinates, then his or her highest-ranking direct subordinate will
 similarly be promoted, and the promotions will cascade down the hierarchy until a person having no subordinates has been
 promoted

    ________________________________________________how the program works_________________________________________________
    You have Tree commands to remember which are Hire,Fire,Print
    -if you want to Hire someone then you need to to write command -->[Existing member] hires [new member]
    -If you want to Fire someone then you need to write command -->Fire [existing member])
    -If you want to Print the current employee hierarchy then you need to write command -->Print
    -If you want to exit from the program then you need to write command -->Quit
