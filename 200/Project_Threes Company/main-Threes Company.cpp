    Threes Company(PDF):
                     This program jacob and edwared will go to the cave to find bella. Jacob explores each passage through the caves one by
                     one, clockwise, while Edward explores each passage through the caves one by one counter-clockwise. Each turn, both
                     Edward and Jacob try to move to a new cave. If either reach Bella (who does not move, since she is so distraught),
                     the simulation ends and Bella marries her rescuer. If they both reach her at the same time, Jacob and Edward
                     and all 3 of them die as a result.

                     To complicate matters, in some of the caves there is naturally growing wolf's bane and Jacob cannot enter those.
                     In other caves there is naturally growing garlic which Edward cannot enter. If either boy is moving towards a cave
                     with a plant they are allergic to, he turns around halfway up the passage and ends up back in the cave he just left.
                     When the simulation starts, Jacob takes the smallest numbered passage, while Edward takes the highest numbered
                     passage. After 100 turns, if no one ands Bella, everyone dies of starvation

 _________________________________________________Rules of the program_________________________________________________

    *This program the rules are very simply which are:
        1) Bella go the one of the cave and she never move from it
        2) jacob go to one of the cave that the user choose for him
        3) Edware go to one of the cave that the user choos for him
        4) Jacob keeps move from cave to another clockwise
        5) Edwared keep move from cave to other counter-clockwise
        6) The caves Edware will go might have allergic so he must check first
        7) The cave Jacob will go might have allergic so he must check first
    *Who wines rules:
        1) if Jacob meets Bella in the cave first then Bella will marry him
        2) if Edwared meet bella in the cave first then Bella will marry him
        3) if Edwared and Jacob meet Bell in the cave together then both Edwared and Jacob dies
        4) If both Edwared and Jacob can't find Bella within 100 moves, then they all dies starving to death


 ________________________________________________how the program inputs works_________________________________________________

  1) the first  line of each test case will contain 4 integers separated by a single space Example (4 1 3 2)
            -The first input in the example above (4) is the number of test case or the number of caves that will be create
                * The next 3 (1  3 2) input are the location of each actors Bella, Edward, and jacob
                * The second number (1) is the location of the cave that bella is located in cave one
                * The Third number (3) is Jacob location which is he located in cave 3
                * The fourth number (2) is where Edware located which is in cave 2.
        so in Simply the inputs are consider in This : number of caves    Bella Location    Jacob location    Edwared Location in caves;
 2) for the next inputs will consider The next n lines will specify the layout of the cave system.
    The  line of the test case  will start with 2 integers.
                * the first integer will consider the allergic which might be -1,0,1 where -1 indicates the presence of garlic in the cave
                  and 1 represents the presence of wolf's bane in the cave, while 0 represents the cave is free of allergen
                * Next will be the integer di , the degree of vertex i, followed by di integers separated by a single space,
                  which represent the caves adjacent to i in clockwise order. The test case starting with 0 0 0 0 will represent t
                  he end of input.
